### processing doesn't work well on windows from command line

PATH doesn't work well, I don't really need to use processing this much, and a VSCode Extension was overkill.

This is an example for how I run processing on my project from the commandline.

The directory handles the problem with my processing installation being in my program files.

Place the script in your processing sketch and run it and it will run the command on the path.
